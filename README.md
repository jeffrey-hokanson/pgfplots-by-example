pgfplots-by-example
===================

[PGFPLOTS](http://pgfplots.sourceforge.net/) is a wonderful package for making
plots that render inside TeX.  This way plots match the styles used in the document
and it is easy to modify display properties (colors, labels, etc).  
The one disadvantage to this package is the syntax is confusing to newcomers. 
This repository hosts a number of examples illustrating the powerful features of
PGFPLOTS.
